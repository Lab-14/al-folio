<p style="text-align:justify"> Presently, I am working as a research scientist (post-doctoral researcher) in <b>Living Analytics Research Centre (LARC)</b> at <b>School of Computing and Information Systems</b>, <b>Singapore Management University</b> under supervision of <b>Prof. Archan Misra</b>. <br> <br>

My research is primarily focused in the areas of the <b>Embedded Sensing, Ubiquitous Computing, Low-power System Design, and Internet-of-Things (IoT)</b>. <br> <br>

Prior to LARC, I have received my Ph.D. training from IIIT-Delhi under wonderful supervision of <b>Dr. Shobha Sundar Ram (Department of Electronics Engineering)</b> and <b>Dr. Amarjeet Singh (Joint faculty - Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering)</b> with a specialization in Embedded Sensing for Energy Sustainability Applications.<br> <br>

During my doctoral studies, I had a chance to work as a visiting researcher with <b>Prof. Shwetak Narain Patel (University of Washington, Seattle, USA)</b> and <b>Sidhant Gupta (Microsoft Research, Redmond)</b> at <b>Ubicomp Lab</b> in <b>Paul G. Allen Centre for Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA (USA)</b> from 2016-2018. <br> <br>

After completing my doctoral research, I have also spent some time consulting with a few technology startups i.e. <b>Aerogram India Pvt. Ltd.</b> focusing on Distributed Air Quality Monitoring and <b>Child Health Imprints Pte. Ltd.</b> which leverages the power of IoT for neonatal health monitoring in NICU's. I have also served a short stint at <b>IIT Kanpur</b> as a visiting faculty for <b>E-ICT Academy</b> in 2019 Summer. <br> <br>

Before joining IIIT-Delhi, I have worked with <b>Hewlett-Packard Educational services (Noida)</b>, <b> WiFinity Tech (Bangalore) </b> and <b> Indrion Technologies (Bangalore) </b> as Embedded Design Engineer where we designed and deployed Wireless Sensor Networks for Smart Energy applications. I received my <b>B.Tech (with Hons.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering</b> in 2011 from <b> Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak </b>. <br> </p>
